> Let's face it, you've been the bad guy all along. And, to be honest, who doesn't crave for some R'lyehlsque world oder? Well, don't wait for Cthulhu's call. Call Him yourself! Get mad! "I'm not waiting for you to finish your endless slumber, how long the hell am I supposed to wait? I demand to see Cthulhu!", you cry out. Well, this didn't quite work, but I'm sure you're going to figure out the correct phrase, eventually. Server: cthulhu.fluxfingers.net Port: 1501
